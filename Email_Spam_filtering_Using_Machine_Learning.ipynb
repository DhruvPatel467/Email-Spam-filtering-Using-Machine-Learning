        "This project focuses on building an Email/SMS Spam Filter using Supervised Machine Learning.\n",
        "The system automatically classifies incoming messages as ‚ÄòSpam‚Äô or ‚ÄòHam (Not Spam)‚Äô based on their content.\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset contains labeled examples of spam and non-spam messages. The text data is preprocessed by converting to lowercase, removing URLs, punctuation, and stopwords, followed by TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features.\n",
        "\n",
        "A Multinomial Naive Bayes classifier is trained on this data to learn spam patterns such as promotional words, links, and trigger phrases. The model is then tested on unseen data to evaluate its accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the system allows users to input any message and instantly predicts whether it is spam or not.\n",
        "The project demonstrates how Supervised Learning can be used to create an intelligent, fast, and efficient spam detection system.\n",

        "\n",
        "Email and SMS spam messages are one of the biggest problems in digital communication. These spam messages often contain unwanted advertisements, fake links, or malicious content. Detecting spam manually is not practical, hence we use **Machine Learning algorithms** to automatically learn patterns from previous labeled messages (spam/ham) and predict the category of new ones.\n",

        "It assumes that features (words) in the message are independent of each other ‚Äî hence ‚Äúnaive‚Äù.\n",
